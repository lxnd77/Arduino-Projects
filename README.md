## ServoRun

### Automatic cup dispenser on coin acceptance
Arduino recieves input from coin acceptor and initiates a servo rotation of 90 degrees and back.
The servo is connected to a star attachment with a metal rod on one of the star points. The metal rod is attached to a Button on a plastic cup dispenser.
On recieving a 1 Ruppee coin, the machine spits out one cup onto a holder. The machine is tamper proof.

## WaterQualityProject

### Output PH and TDS values to a screen

PH and TDS sensor, with output on screen with tvOut library (https://github.com/Avamander/arduino-tvout)
Drawback: Have to manually take out the PH sensor I utilised, since it is a laborotorial sensor and cannot be submerged 24/7. Can be solved by using a more expensive sensor.
